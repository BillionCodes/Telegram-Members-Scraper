Telegram Members Scraper + Bulk Adder
-----------------------------------


This scripts perform two things
scraper.py
--------------------------------------------
This script is for scraper all members in a telegram group, you have to be in the group to be able to extract members.
The members are extracted to a file called 'members.csv' by default but you can change it if you know python. cheers

--------------------------------------------

Adder.py
--------------------------------------------
This script automatically picks the 'member.csv' file in the same directory, and adds all members to your telegram group by choice.
note: telegram limits adding users to 200 per day so you might start getting floodcrm error message. once that happens just stop script to avoiding getting temporary ban. Thank you
